# INTRODUCTION :-

This project is a replica of the Tableau Analytics and Visualization challenge. The data contained in this file includes sales and promotional information from a sampling of stores.
The workbook provides an end-to-end visualization product using a large dataset. Attached is the dataset that need to use for the implementation. The dataset is an excel workbook containing 3 worksheets where, each worksheet is a dataset. Since, all the datasets are related I used combiner and used all the datasets. We can refer to the glossary worksheet for the data set details. Also, I have taken some time to get an additional msa dataset that would help identify the locations based on the US national msa location encoding.

# OBJECTIVE :-

* Perform exploratory data analysis.
* Analyze sales and revenue trends over the years across various demographics like categories, locations etc...
* Build visualization that would uncover any significant trends in data and Identify factors that could influence the sales and increase revenue numbers.
* Based on the visualizations and analysis provide top 3 recommendations that would enable business growth over the upcoming years and why.
* The project is present in the tableau packaged workbook (workbook.twbx file) which contain one storyboard with all the visualization worksheets and dashboards formatted and labelled appropriately. The final slide 
  of the storyboard contains recommendations for the sales business based on the EDA.
